Logo Placeholder Directory
==========================

This directory should contain:

1. default.png - Your company/customer logo (recommended: 280x80px)
2. pragyaa.png - Pragyaa.ai logo for "Powered by" footer (recommended: 200x56px)

For customer deployments:
- Replace default.png with the customer's logo
- Or set NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_LOGO in .env.local to a custom path

File naming convention for multi-tenant setups:
- {customerSlug}.png - e.g., acme.png for customerSlug="acme"

Recommended logo formats:
- PNG with transparent background
- SVG for scalable graphics
- Dimensions: 280x80px for header, 200x56px for footer

Note: If logos are missing, the UI will show broken image placeholders.
Please add your logo files before deploying to production.
